        <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Installing a custom ROM on Huawei hi6250 devices</h2>
        21.01.2024<br><br><br>

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>My devices: PRA-LX1, WAS-LX1</p>
        <p>This guide is mostly for future me just in case I'll need to reflash/flash custom ROM on these Huawei devices. Because of how Huawei made its smartphones, we need to follow more complicated steps than when flashing custom ROMs on other OEMs. Because of the same software working on both these devices I won't write on which I install what.</p>

        <br>
                <h2>Unlocking, and installing a ROM</h2>
        <p>For unlocking the bootloader/FRP see <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV">PotatoNV</a>.</p>

        <p>For AOSP up to Android 11 (without Gapps!) there's no need for resizing the system partition on the stock, but for LineageOS (from AltairFR) you need to follow the resizing steps from <a class="underline" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-prague-11-lineageos-18-1-for-huawei-p8-lite-2017.4275551/">this thread</a>, do resizing on Windows, because Linux scripts are incomplete! I had installed LineageOS 18.1 with Android 11 and it was working mostly well, but I think that it's too much for this phone at this stage, so I reverted to AOSP.</p>

        <p>For installing AOSP I followed <a class="underline" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-11-darkjoker360-aosp-11-for-huawei-p8-lite-2017.4220705/">this thread</a>. It didn't pass the splash screen so I flashed it again, this time I decrypted the data partition using DarkJoker's utility and AltairFR's from the Lineage thread, I also flashed Magisk (don't know which of these worked, I think that decrypting and Magisk combined). Also I looked into /vendor/etc/fstab file and didn't have encryption, see <a class="underline" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/aio-prepare-your-device-and-your-knowledge-for-any-gsi.3812024/">this thread</a>.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Regarding the webview and browsing the web</h2>

        <p>AOSP (Android 10, 11), and Lineage (Android 10, 8.1) from DarkJoker360 don't have updated <a class="underline" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView">webview</a>, which is necessary for browsing the web on older devices, because for example on <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android">Fennec browser</a> (with GeckoView) Github took 15 seconds to load, but on <a class="underline" href="https://slions.net/resources/fulguris.10/">Fulguris browser</a> (with system webview AND ad-block) 5 seconds, I'm using the Github as a benchmark, because it's the most bloated website I know of. As of right now the version 81 of the WebView is working fairly well with rendering every page (except for the Github README.md file only, and WSJ).</p>

        <br>
        <p>There are a few WebView providers e.g. <a class="underline" href="https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mulch">Mulch</a>, <a class="underline" href="https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view">Bromite</a>, or <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium">Vanadium</a> which have more up-to-date versions, that will need to be used in the future.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Update 25.01.2024</h2>

        <p>Okay, so I installed the LineageOS 17.1 (Android 10) from DarkJoker, and it costantly restarted the System UI. To fix it I did <a class="underline" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-10-lineageos-17-1-for-huawei-p8-lite-2017.4064121/post-83043203">this</a> (basically first wiped everything with DarkJoker's TWRP, then flashed Dil3mm'4s TWRP with it I flashed then the system.img, and everything worked well).</p>
