        <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">IvoryOS 1.0 is here!</h2>
        <p>After a long time (since july) I'm presenting the <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/ivoryos">IvoryOS 1.0</a>!</p>
        <p>It's an <a class="underline" href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> based <a class="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlD9UBTcSW4">GNU/Linux</a> distribution, which runs on <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86_64</a> architecture. It has <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">TUI</a> install wizard, and is more or less versatile!</p>
        <p>First it was an install script, then I created a simple Arch install medium with a script that will be executed and do a lot of stuff for me (like installing the base system), and then added an option for it to download my dotfiles into it. Looking back at it, I think that it was well thought (I guess). I didn't plan on making it modular, but made it by chance. Because of it you can install basic Arch without anything and then provide your dotfiles for it - modular design. Thanks to it I can update my dotfiles without the need of updating ISO every single time.</p>
        <p>There is still stuff to add to it (and fix :/), but it's more or less ready for 1.0 release.</p>
