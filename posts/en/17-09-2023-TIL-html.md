# What I learned from making this site

##### 17-09-2023

## HTML

<!-- Render as: `<em>, <strong>` because it thinks that I want to use them -->
Not that much, I already knew my way around HTML. Now I know more about text tags: `&lt;em&gt;`, `&lt;strong&gt;` etc.
Discovered the `&lt;button&gt;` tag, and don't know whether it is the same as the `input type="button"` tag.

## CSS

Well, CSS always was my weakness, but now I know more for example about flexboxes and how they work.
`margin` and `padding` are now more understandable for me.

## JavaScript

JS can do many things. I'm happy that markdown parser worked out at the end.

## Conclusion

Writing my own site was worth the effort. Now I can write websites more easily.
